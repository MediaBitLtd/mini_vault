MiniVault is a free Password Manager for your home lab setup. It's intended to provide basic storage of your passwords and secrets, along side OAuth2 authentication for your server applications. It supports various types of secrets including TwoFactor authentication, all secured using password hash encryption.

**Warning** - Use this at your own risk and do not expose this app to public, as it increase the chances you your own setup being targeted to an attack.

It works by encrypting the user's main password against any record and vault created. Your passwords (and any information stored in MiniVault) is secured using bcrypt encryption and never stored in plain text. No data is accessible without the user's main password. This also means that if you lose your main password, you will **never** be able to recover your data - don't forget your main password!

## Setup

Installation instructions will depend on your own environment and it's not recommended for beginners to install MiniVault from scratch. Please make sure you have all requisites for a <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/deployment">Laravel</a> web app to run, and setup your application accordingly. You should then copy from `.env.example` into `.env` and modify accordingly, making sure to do it according to your setup.

Once you have your application setup, run the migrations using `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`. The default user will be `admin@example.com` and `password` as the password. You can change these on the admin panel (See below)

Alternatively, and **recommended**, you can use Docker to install it, by simply creating copying the following to `docker-composer.yml` in an empty folder:

```YML
services:
  miniv:
    image: mediabit/miniv:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 9035:80
    environment:
      - APP_URL: 'https://miniv.myawesomelab.local' # This will be your url for your new password manager. Don't use vault.* as browsers tend to block it for security
      - ADMIN_EMAIL: 'admin@example.com' # Your admin email
      - ADMIN_PASSWORD: 'password' # Your admin password | recommended to change after
      - USER_EMAIL: 'user@example.com' # Your first user email. If not supplied, it will not create this user
      - USER_PASSWORD: 'password' # Your initial password. You will be asked to change it on first login
```

#### After installation

Once your app is installed and running, login into it using the credentials you setup for admin. <small>Default is `admin@example.com` : `password`</small>

In the admin panel, you should change the password of the admin user by editing it. You can then create a `non-admin` user by clicking `New User`. The password you select will be a temporary one, as the user will asked to change the password again once first login.

You can also setup any OAuth2.0 clients in the admin panel, providing a single authentication system for your homelab.
